## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
The point of sale (POS) application developed using Netbeans is a comprehensive solution designed to meet the needs of businesses looking for a reliable and user-friendly platform for managing their sales transactions. The application offers a range of functionalities, including adding items, calculating the total, subtotal, tax, change, and payment method. It also includes a numpad for easy entry of amounts, clear, reset, pay, print, and exit options to streamline the checkout process. The application is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a clean and modern user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and operate. This POS application is an excellent choice for businesses looking for an efficient and robust sales management solution. I took almost 10 hrs to complete this project.
